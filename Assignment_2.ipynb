    "# Training a simple Linear Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will write the code to train a Linear Model. The goal is to classify and input $x_n$ of size $n$ into one of $m$ classes. For this goal, you need to create the following parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) ** A weight Matrix $W_{n\\times m}$ **, where the Weights are multipled to the input $X_n$ (Vector of size $n$), to find $m$ scores $S_m$ for the $m$ classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) ** The Loss function **: We learnt two Kinds of Loss functions:\n",
    "  *  The Hinge Loss: This loss measures, for each sample, how many times were the wrong classes scored above correct class score - $\\Delta$ ? and by how much? This leads to the formulation:\n",
    "  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "L_i = \\sum_{j\\neq y_i} \\max(0, s_j - s_{y_i} + \\Delta)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_i$ is the correct class, and $s_j$ is the score for the $j$-th class (the $j$-th element of $S_m$)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * The softmax Loss: By interpreting the scores as unnormalized log probabilities for each class, this loss tries to measure dissatisfaction with the scores in terms of the log probability of the right class:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L_i = -\\log\\left(\\frac{e^{f_{y_i}}}{ \\sum_j e^{f_j} }\\right) \\hspace{0.5in} \\text{or equivalently} \\hspace{0.5in} L_i = -f_{y_i} + \\log\\sum_j e^{f_j}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f_{ y_i }$ is the $i$-th element of the output of $W^T_{n \\times m} . X_m$\n",
    "\n",
    "4) ** Regularization term **: In addition to the loss, you need a Regularization term to lead to a more distributed( in case of $L_2$) or sparse (in case of $L_1$) learning of the weights. For example, and having $L_2$ regularization would imply that your loss has the following additional term:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R(W) = \\sum_k\\sum_l W_{k,l}^2,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "making the total loss:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L =  \\underbrace{ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i L_i }_\\text{data loss} + \\underbrace{ \\lambda R(W) }_\\text{regularization loss} \\\\\\\\\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3) ** An Optimization Procedure **: This refers to the process which tweaks the weight Matrix $W_{n\\times m}$ to reduce the loss function $L$. In our case, this refers to Mini-batch Gradient Descent algorithm. We adjust the weights $W_{n\\times m}$, based on the gradient of the loss $L$ w.r.t. $W_{n\\times m}$. This leads to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W_{t+1} = W_{t} + \\alpha \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is the learning rate. Additionally, as we will be doing \"mini-batch\" gradient Descent, instead of finding loss over the whole dataset, we find it only for a small sample of the traning data for each learning step we take. Basically,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W_{t+1} = W_{t} + \\alpha \\frac{\\partial \\sum^{b}{L_{x_i}}}{\\partial W},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where, $b$ is the batch size."
